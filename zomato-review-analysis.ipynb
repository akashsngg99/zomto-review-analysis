Masala tea was not even brewed and was made out of tea bags which was priced at 120 Rs. Left it after two sips.\\\\n\\\\nPesto Garlic bread was average but was priced at 200 Rs! Virgin mojito tasted like it was just sweet sugar syrup with a hint of lime.\\\\n\\\\nOverall not worth the price being charged for the quality of food.

But since I went there post lunch couldn\\'t try. A quiet place on the main road. Perfect to hang out after work with friends or even family.
